Aspiring AI Engineer with a strong foundation in Agentic AI and hands-on experience in Python, machine learning, and deep learning. I specialize in building intelligent Agents and workflows that merge AI with industrial applications. Proficient in modern AI tools including FastAPI, LangChain, LangGraph, Openai Agents SDK, Crewai, Autogen, MCP, Docker, and OpenAI APIs, Iâ€™ve developed real-world projects such as resume optimizers using LLM agents, RAG-based knowledge assistants. My academic background from the University of the Punjab has provided me with a solid grasp of reaction kinetics, process control, and chemical processes. Currently pursuing AI-focused certifications to enhance my skills further, I thrive in fast-paced, research-driven environments where I can continuously learn and solve real-world challenges at the intersection of AI and engineering.
